     * Exercise #2 - Retail Price Calculator
     * 
     * Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and 
     * its markup percentage. It should then display the item's retail price. 
     * For example:
     *   - If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100 
     *       percent, then the item's retail price is 10.00.
     *   - If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 
     *       percent, then the item's retail price is 7.50.
     * The program should reference a method named calculateRetail that receives 
     * the wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments, and returns 
     * the retail price of the item.

     * 
     * A painting company has determined that for every 115 square feet of wall 
     * space, one gallon of paint and eight hours of labour will be required. 
     * The company charges $18.00 per hour for labour. Write a program that 
     * allows the user to enter the number of rooms to be painted and the price 
     * of the paint per gallon. It should also ask for the square feet of wall 
     * space in each room. The program should have methods with the following 
     * names that return the following data:
     *   - numGallons: The number of gallons of paint required
     *   - hoursLabour: The hours of labour required
     *   - costPaint: The cost of the paint
     *   - labourCharges: The labour charges

     * Then it should display the data on the screen.

     * Exercise #13 - isPrime Method
     * 
     * A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. 
     * For example, the number 5 is prime because it can be evenly divided only 
     * by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided 
     * evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
     * Write a method named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and 
     * returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise.
